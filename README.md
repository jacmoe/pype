Personal Yii Page Engine


A live instance of Pype can be seen here: [pype.jacmoe.dk](https://pype.jacmoe.dk)

This is a minimal wrapper application for the [yii2-mdpages-module](https://github.com/jacmoe/yii2-mdpages-module) which serves static markdown documents from a separate Git repository.

The goal is to create a small, fast and versatile flat-file engine that is suitable for serving blogs, wikis and personal websites.

The application should be easy to upgrade and manage.

[Deployer](http://deployer.org/) is used for deployment, and [Flywheel](https://github.com/jamesmoss/flywheel) is used for temporary storage of processed documents.

And, last - but not least: Pype is powered by the [Yii Framework](http://www.yiiframework.com/)
